IO::RawChar

   Little module to accept non-blocking characters from the terimal on Linux.
   This can be used to look for user keypresses during long-running operations.
   Combined with a module like Terminal::Spinners you can provide a progress
   bar and still allow the user to interrupt the process on demand by pressing
   "Q" or whatever key is appropriate.

Note:
	
	Once the class has been instantiated, the terminal will be in "raw" mode
	which will be a problem for the user if it isn't reset before program end.
	So this class will reset the terminal if SIGTERM is sent to the program.
	It's up to you to make sure that SIGTERM causes the program to exit after
	that.

Bugs:

	The input is single byte ASCII characters rather than Unicode.  Sorry.
